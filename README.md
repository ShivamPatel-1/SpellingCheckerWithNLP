# SpellingCheckerWithNLP

 Spelling Correction Suggestion System demonstrates how to implement an intelligent
spell-checker in Python using libraries like NLTK, Pattern, and Matplotlib. The project
involves reading and processing text data, generating possible corrections using various
word edit operations, calculating probabilities of corrections based on word frequency, and visualizing the suggested corrections. This system aids in enhancing text accuracy and user experience by providing likely word suggestions, beneficial for applications in word processors, search engines, and text-based interfaces globally.
